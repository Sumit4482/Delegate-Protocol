### **Part 3: Delegates**

**Objective:** Understand and implement the delegate pattern in Swift.

**Tasks:**

1. Create a new Swift file named Delegates.swift.
2. Define a protocol named TaskDelegate with a method taskDidComplete.
3. Create a class Task that has a delegate property conforming to TaskDelegate.
4. Implement a class TaskHandler that conforms to TaskDelegate and handles the completion of the task.
5. Demonstrate the delegate pattern by creating an instance of Task, setting its delegate to an instance of TaskHandler, and simulating the completion of a task.

### **Test Coverage**
I'm skipping test cases because this project involves no complex logic or computation.
